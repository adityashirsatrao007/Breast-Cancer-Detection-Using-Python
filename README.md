# Breast Cancer Detection Using Python

This repository contains a project for detecting breast cancer using Python and machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a predictive model that can classify whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on various features extracted from medical data.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset:** The project uses the `breastcancer.csv` file, which is included in the repository. This dataset contains features related to breast cancer diagnosis.
- **Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Objective:** To analyze breast cancer data and build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the presence of cancer.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training and evaluation using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.
- Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix
- Visualization of results

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (install using pip):

  ```
  pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
  ```

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/adityashirsatrao007/Breast-Cancer-Detection-Using-Python.git
   ```

2. Place the `breastcancer.csv` file in the project directory (already included).

3. Run the main Python script (e.g., `main.py` or the relevant notebook):

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## File Structure

- `breastcancer.csv` - Dataset file
- `main.py` or notebook - Main code for preprocessing, model building, and evaluation
- `README.md` - Project documentation

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated using standard classification metrics. Visualizations are provided to understand data distribution and model effectiveness.
